# MiniScripterAPI
Little API i made for me and more people if they want to use it..
# Documentation
base64Encrypt and base64Decrypt, does what you think, encrypts/decrypts the input<br><br>
loadScript adds the script you input to the page<br><br>
fetchReturnText fetch'es the input(has to be an url) and returns the data<br><br>
getCookie does what you think, get a cookie by its name(input)<br><br>
evalURL evaluates data in the url you input<br><br>
saveData, loadData, loads and saves data to the localStorage, data has to be an object<br><br>
listData finds all the data saved to the localStorage using this api(ends with -saveData)<br><br>
urlParams.currentPage/otherpageURL gets the params of the current url or other urls parameters<br><br>
<br>
Currently, this is all but i'll try to add more in the future
This documentation might be ugly and the code might be bad but i'm still learning...
